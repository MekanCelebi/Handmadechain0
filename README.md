Blockchain Marketplace for Handmade Goods
🧶 Overview
This project is a decentralized e-commerce platform designed to enable artisans and creators to securely sell handmade products using blockchain technology. The system represents physical products as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), ensuring authenticity, ownership traceability, and secure transactions via smart contracts and a built-in escrow service.

🎯 Purpose
The primary aim is to merge the trust and transparency of blockchain with traditional handmade goods marketplaces. This allows users to:

Prove the authenticity and origin of handmade products through NFTs

Ensure secure and fair transactions using blockchain-powered escrow

Create a transparent ecosystem for artisans and buyers globally

🔑 Key Features
NFT Minting: Sellers can mint NFTs linked to their handmade goods.

Secure Purchases: Buyers purchase items using cryptocurrency and receive the item along with its NFT.

Blockchain Escrow: Funds are held in escrow until delivery is confirmed by the buyer.

Decentralized Transparency: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for full traceability.

User-Friendly UI: Clean and responsive interface for both buyers and sellers.

Wallet Integration: Web3 wallet support (MetaMask, etc.) for seamless blockchain interaction.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS
